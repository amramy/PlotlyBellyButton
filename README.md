# Plotly Discovering Belly Button BioDiversity

## Objective: 
"Improbable Beef" is looking for a bacterium to manufacture synthetic beef.
If Improbable Beef identify a species of bacteria that is found in some belly buttons the volunteers will
be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel at our website.

My role was to help Roza complete a dashboard of demographic information and visualization on belly button
bacteria data for our various volunteers. Our volunteers will be able to identify the top 10 
bacterial species in their belly buttons by selecting their ID number from the drop-down menu. 
If they are a match that Improbable Beef is looking for, they will be able to easily identify the bacteria and quantity. 

#### Upon Arrival to the Dashboard
